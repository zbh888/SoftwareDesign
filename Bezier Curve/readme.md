Attention:

1. New, Load, Quit will make suggestion if you didn't save your work, or you made some action after you saved last time. You could just click OK, and then New, Load, Quit would not bother you any more. They won't care about if you saved or not if you it is just a blank canvas or you just load from another file... 

Also, New will set the default mode to drawing mode. The things copied would not remain. (if you want to want to copy a curve into a new canvas, you can delete all other curves. I think it will be a little bit wierd to keep copy since you want the whole thing new, right?)

2. If you think you finished drawing, press ESC or just simply change to another mode will work (sometimes we, maybe just me, just too lazy to touch keyboard.)

3. If you change the thickness to small, then it might be a little bit hard to select, but you could easily select a large size curve.... (Oh, that happens when you delete, too)

4. The default is the max size, but you can resize it.

5. The left bottom corner has some info to indicate you. Drawing is Yes means you are drawing not selecting (I also changed the color of control points due to this), and Copying is Yes means you actually copied something. And those info, and color picker updates if you select a curve.

6. Addtional Feature is Copy, Cut, Paste

Usage:

If you don't select any curve, at the beginning, you can't Copy, Cut, or Paste...obviously

So, you select a curve, and then try copying, or cutting it. They would work. (Your copy will be saved if you click Load, or Save as mentioned above, but copy disappears if you click New)

And then you could be able to select Paste, and entering Pasting mode. You click any point on canvas, and that will be the leftmost start point of the copied curve. You can paste as many as you like, and you can exit the paste mode by clicking StopPaste.
